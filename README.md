# py-hangman

### Check the README_pt-BR.md if you are brazilian :D

This is one of my first projects in python.
To play, you will need python3 installed, and you can just use "python3 hangman.py". But, also, there is some some parsing arguments you can use:

### --help, -h
Show the default help message generated by python's argparse.

### --inputlist, -i
Picks a the word from an external list. The text file must have one word per line.

### --length, -l
I believe this is self-explanatory. Basically, you can specify the length of the word that you want.

### --language, -L
Recently add, use to specify language to be used. Supported at the moment: 'en-US', 'pt-BR'.

### --word, -w
Passing this argument allow you to specify the word to be used, it jumps right to the game with the given word. It's useful, if you're playing with someone else, for instance.

### Examples:
python3 hangman.py -w example  
python3 hangman.py --word umbrella  
python3 hangman.py -i './words.txt'  
python3 hangman.py -i '/home/user/words.txt' -l 6  
python3 hangman.py -L 'pt-BR' -l 6
